## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

- What is the background of your project?
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Problem Statement: You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The data given in a csv contains information about bike usage in the years 2018 and 2019 per day alogn with parameters such as weather situation, temperature, humidity , wind speed etc.
